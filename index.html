<h4>Embedded Checkout&nbsp;<span class="label label-warning">Bread Finance</span></h4>
<p>
Merchants hate it when a service provider takes you away from their page to perform a transaction.  At Bread, we provided a <a href='https://developers.getbread.com'>straightforward API</a>
to easily integrate any storefront experience with Bread Financing.  The button can look like our default button, but is completely customizable for those who preferred a whitelabeled solution.

<h4>Cross Portal Search <span class="label label-warning">Admeld</span></h4>
<p>
Between Users, Ad Network Accounts, Creatives, Orders and a whole other mess of other things... finding a particular
piece of information quickly was a trial for internal Admeld users.  Cross Portal Search (affectionately known as 'Corporal
Smurf' after a post-dentist talk with the CTO) was a data-type agnostic search engine to find whatever you
were looking for.</p>
<p>
This search engine indexed all the important metadata about every piece of data in our system to allow quick recall
from virtually anything you wanted to search on.  This was built in Java using Lucene, although if Elasticsearch were
around at the time it would have made my job a lot easier.  This is a nice segway in to the next item...

<h4>Inventory Search <span class="label label-info">isocket</span></h4>
<p>
isocket's core mission is to make it easier for Publishers and Advertisers to find each other and do business directly.
Central to that goal is the ability to find inventory available on a particular site by virtually any number of vectors, such as comScore demographics, ad placement, price, IAB category... even weather - although no one has ever used that.</br>

<h4>Content Categorizer / Search <span class="label label-inverse">Monitor110</span></h4>
<p>
As User Generated Content came on to the web, Monitor110 ingested content in to it's multi-stage processing service.
Using a homegrown Bayesian categorization engine, articles are tagged with relevant stock tickers or category.  Daily
re-training of the engine actually refined the queries such that after a period of time we would see articles
popping up in a topic that we had not put in a single training term for.
</p>
<p>
The best example of this was during the time of the first iPhone.  Rumors were circulating that Apple was releasing a
phone and the internet chatter had dubbed it the 'Jesus Phone'.  Within a few days, articles mentioning 'Jesus Phone' and no other Apple-esque terms started appearing in the APPL ticker.  We all ran away terrified as the now-sentient system threatened to blog mean things about us.

<h4>RTB Analytics <span class="label label-warning">Admeld</span></h4>
<p>
Insight in to how a Publisher was making money off Admeld's RTB platform was essential to selling the concept of RTB, as
well as providing any shred of market intelligence to a typically black-boxed world.
</p>
<p>
The RTB Analytics platform leveraged our already existing (and ever growing) Hadoop-based data aggregation system.  By
slicing different types of data in to pivotable chunks, we were able to present clear and dynamic visualizations of how
a Publisher was making money.  (Screenshot hopefully coming).

<h4>Web Automation <span class="label label-warning">Admeld</span></h4>
<p>
Web Automation grew out of two essential needs :
<ul>
<li>Providing Publishers all the data they needed in one place.</li>
<li>Insight in to what the Ad Networks were doing to enable our Ad Servers to make more informed decisions.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We built a system that would log in to various ad network reporting systems (very few had APIs) and scrape out relevant
impression and payment data.  This data would be used alongside our own reporting information to uncover discrepancies.  As
an example :
</p>
<p>
We would request to serve an Ad from both <strong>Ad Network A</strong> and <strong>Ad Network B</strong>.  <strong>Ad Network A</strong>
would tell us they pay $1 per impression, while <strong>Ad Network B</strong> would report they only paid $0.90.  We would serve <strong>A</strong>.  After scraping numbers from their reporting system and comparing them against our own numbers, we would see that <strong>Ad Network A</strong> would underreport the impressions - either for nefarious reasons or just lack of technical sophistication.  We
would know that we served 100, but they would report 80.  This meant that we're getting paid only $80 for 100 impressions while
serving from <strong>Ad Network B</strong> (who reported more accurately) would have netted us $90.  The Ad Server would then work off
our own internally derived CPM and favor the <em>true</em> higher price.  Ad Network names have been removed to protect the innocent.
</p>
The system was built in a time before really cool stuff like <a href="http://agouti.org/" target="_blank">Agouti</a> existed, so we
rolled our own solution.  A service would fire up individually addressable instances of Firefox, which had ports open to allow us to
inject our own Javascript in to the page.  Every page the browser visited would then contain our own admeld.js which had methods we
could call from the main Java scraping service.  (i.e. pullTableColumns would exist as a Java method which then call the corresponding
Javascript function through the JSSH port).
</p>
<p>
With this framework now in place, I built a runner that would use Groovy scripts that were custom built for each reporting platform.  User
credentials were injected in, and the service would return simple JSON results from the scrape.  We were essentially API-afying a site
and normalizing their data to fit in to our system in a clear and IAB standards-compliant way.  It was easily one of our biggest wins,
and often cited as a key reason Google aquired Admeld.

<h4>Bezerk and Smoosh <span class="label label-warning">Admeld</span></h4>
<p>
Why "map" when you can Bezerk?  Why "reduce" when you can Smoosh?  In order for Admeld's ad servers to make intelligent decisions,
we needed to know what they were doing.
</p>
<p>
Ad Server clusters in multiple co-locations dumped billions of lines of log data.  More often than not, a single request would
span multiple servers.  Small (local) Hadoop clusters would grab 15 minute increments of log data from all the servers, and then
combine these lines together in to a coherent RequestChain object which would represent only the relevant (non-duplicated) data points about that particular request.  These newly smooshed objects would then stream in to the central Hadoop cluster for some serious
crunching.  At any given time, we were no more than 15 minutes off real-time with our reporting.  This was huge, as most Publishers
were accostomed to only getting this data every few days, or sometimes even a whole month.  Combined with the Web Automation system,
we were able to have a complete view of what was going on in what was quickly becoming a very very large ecosystem.

<h4>Disaster Alerts in Google Search / Android <span class="label label-success">Google</span></h4>
<p>
Cellular providers have been required by law to (finally) start pushing out timely public safety alerts to phones.&nbsp;&nbsp;These alerts are usually in all caps and accompanied by an obscenely scary noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the data that the Public Alerts team is already ingesting, we wanted to supplant (or at least suppliment) these alerts with something less panic-inducing, and more information forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mission was to replace <b>"FLOOD WARNING"</b> with a map and detailed (decapitalized) information such as time, duration, depth, likelihood... all the stuff that matters when you need it most.
</p>
<p>
My particular contribution to this project was to take the alert text from sources like the National Weather Service and extract out the most relevant parts and recombine them to form a useful and informative snippet.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on a Tornado warning I'd focus more on directional and temporal aspects rather than rainfall amounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was done by tokenizing the text and weighting certain n-grams based on the alert type.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also worked on the UI for both the Web, and Android.
</p>
<p>
These alerts were intended originally for only for Maps on the Android platform, but once demo'd we were asked to put them in Google Web Search, iOS Maps, and Google Now.

<h4>Power Outage/Gas Supply Maps During Hurricane Sandy <span class="label label-success">Google</span></h4>
<p>
During Hurricane Sandy, the NYC branch of the Google Crisis Response team had a rare opportunity to operate in an area where we were actively responding as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we were able to work closely with NYC Department of Emergency Management and the NYC Mayors office, we were able to get access to power outage data we normally were never allowed to use and plot it on our Crisis Map.
</p>
<p>
There was a more interesting data point we were able to capture as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a lot of software engineers who no longer had to go to work for the week and were forming up under IRC and Twitter as "Hurricane Hackers" to try to help out in any way they could.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to engage that community and Google provided resources to help them, and they in turn were able to hack together a gas supply data set that I was then able to plot on the Crisis Map.&nbsp;&nbsp;While probably not in any way the most difficult thing I've worked on, it's the only thing I've ever built that I saw on CNN while I was coding it.

<h4>Dogfort <span class="label label-important">Side Project</span></h4>
<p>
Anti-social networking.  As my circle of eng friends from Admeld got thrown to the diaspora, we could no longer all communicate
via shared Skype session or on corporate GTalk.  Also, most chat platforms were pretty weak on showing images and video.  We tried
our own private sub-reddit, and a number of other things and finally Dogfort was born.  It had a few key essential features:
<ul>
  <li>Invite Only</li>
  <li>One-click image/video sharing from anywhere</li>
  <li>Group chat</li>
  <li>Abundant shaming for reposting an image</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Built under cover of darkness, and usually while a little drunk - Dogfort has been through many iterations.  Direct contact with Dogfort users provide a clean and efficient feedback loop for incorporating new features.  Today's version has a voting system, comments, and a Chrome extension to allow for quick posting.  Built using AngularJS on the frontend and Node.js on the back, Dogfort
also gives me an awesome playground to try out new technologies before advocating for them in my paying gig.</br>
